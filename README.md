- price_per_night: Cost to book per night

Relationships:
- A property is created by a user (host)
- A property can have many bookings
- A property can receive multiple reviews

### Bookings: Reservations made by guests to stay at properties.
Key Fields:
- id: Unique identifier
- user_id: The guest who made the booking
- property_id: The property being booked
- check_in_date: Start date of the booking
- check_out_date: End date of the booking

Relationships:
- A booking belongs to one user (guest)
- A booking is for one property
- A booking may result in a payment

### Payments: Transaction details related to bookings.
Key Fields:
- id: Unique identifier
- booking_id: The related booking
- amount: Total amount charged
- payment_method: e.g., card, wallet, PayPal
- status: Paid, pending, failed, etc.
  
Relationships:
- A payment is tied to one booking
- A user indirectly relates through their booking

## Feature Breakdown
### User Management
- This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures secure access to the platform and supports both guests and hosts, allowing them to perform role-specific actions such as booking properties or listing them for rent.
### Property Management
- Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature enables the core business function of offering places to stay, and includes metadata like location, pricing, availability, and amenities.
### Booking System
- Allows users to book properties for specific dates, manage their bookings, and check availability. It links users to properties and ensures that scheduling conflicts are avoided, making the experience seamless for both guests and hosts.
### Payment Processing
- Handles the financial transactions tied to bookings. This feature ensures secure, trackable, and successful payments through various methods (e.g., card, wallet), which is essential for trust and functionality in a rental marketplace.
### Review System
- Enables users to rate and review properties after their stay. It fosters transparency, helps build community trust, and provides quality assurance by allowing feedback on the booking experience and property condition.
### API Documentation (REST + GraphQL)
- APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard and also support GraphQL for more flexible querying. This ensures that developers (front-end or third-party integrators) can easily interact with the backend services during integration and development.
### Database Optimization
- Includes techniques like indexing and caching to ensure fast and efficient data retrieval. This is critical for performance, especially as the number of users, properties, and bookings scales over time.

## API Security Overview
### Authentication
- What It Is: Verifies the identity of users during login using secure methods (e.g., hashed passwords, token-based systems like JWT or session cookies).
- Why It’s Crucial: Prevents unauthorized access to personal accounts, ensuring that only legitimate users can perform sensitive actions like bookings or property management.
### Authorization
- What It Is: Controls access to resources based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host vs. admin). For example, only a host can modify their own listings.
- Why It’s Crucial: Ensures users can only access or modify data they own or have permission for, preventing malicious or accidental misuse of the platform.
### Rate Limiting & Throttling
- What It Is: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe to prevent abuse (e.g., brute force attacks or API flooding).
- Why It’s Crucial: Protects backend resources from being overwhelmed by malicious bots or DDoS attacks, and helps preserve availability and performance.
### Data Encryption
- What It Is: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (using HTTPS/SSL) and at rest (e.g., hashed passwords, encrypted tokens).
- Why It’s Crucial: Protects user credentials, payment data, and personal information from being intercepted or leaked during communication or storage.
### Input Validation & Sanitization
- What It Is: Ensures that incoming data is clean, safe, and adheres to expected formats, preventing injections or malformed requests.
- Why It’s Crucial: Prevents SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other common attack vectors that exploit user input.
### Secure Payment Processing
- What It Is: Integration with trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) using tokenized transactions, and never storing raw card details on the backend.
- Why It’s Crucial: Protects financial data and ensures compliance with PCI-DSS standards, safeguarding both users and the platform from fraud or breaches.
### Security Testing & Auditing
- What It Is: Includes automated tests (e.g., static analysis), manual code reviews, and vulnerability scanning to proactively detect and patch issues.
- Why It’s Crucial: Security isn’t a one-time setup—it must be continuously evaluated and improved to handle evolving threats.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview
### What Are CI/CD Pipelines?
- CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code.

- Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase, reducing integration issues.
- Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically releases code to production (or staging) once it passes all tests, ensuring fast and reliable delivery.
### Why CI/CD Is Important for the Airbnb Clone Project
- Ensures Code Quality: Automatically runs tests and linting tools on each push to catch bugs early.
- Speeds Up Deployment: Reduces manual effort and risk during deployment, allowing new features to reach users faster.
- Improves Collaboration: Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute safely and consistently.
- Enhances Reliability: Detects regressions before they reach production and allows quick rollbacks when needed.
### Recommended Tools
- GitHub Actions: For automating CI/CD workflows directly from GitHub.
- Docker: For containerizing the application to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- PostgreSQL: Used in test environments to mirror production database behavior.
