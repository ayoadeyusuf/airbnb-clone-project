# airbnb-clone-project

## Objective
- The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

- Project Goals
-- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
-- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
-- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
-- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
-- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
-- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

- A property can receive multiple reviews

### Bookings: Reservations made by guests to stay at properties.
- Key Fields:
- id: Unique identifier
- user_id: The guest who made the booking
- property_id: The property being booked
- check_in_date: Start date of the booking
- check_out_date: End date of the booking

- Relationships:
- A booking belongs to one user (guest)
- A booking is for one property
- A booking may result in a payment

### Payments: Transaction details related to bookings.
- Key Fields:
- id: Unique identifier
- booking_id: The related booking
- amount: Total amount charged
- payment_method: e.g., card, wallet, PayPal
- status: Paid, pending, failed, etc.
- Relationships:
- A payment is tied to one booking
- A user indirectly relates through their booking
